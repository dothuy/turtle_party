#Turtle party
#Create a spiral function that takes the length of the longest side and the angle of the spiral as parameters and draws a spiral shape where the side length shrinks (or grows) after every turn: 
import turtle
turtle.color("red")

def drawSpiral(longestSide, angle, step):
  #Return error if longestSide is negative number
  if longestSide<0:
    print("Error! Can't draw a Spiral with a negative number")
  else:
    for i in range (1, longestSide, step):
      print(i)
      turtle.forward(i)
      turtle.left(angle)
      

#test function with longestSide is a negative number ->Error
drawSpiral(-30, 40, 1)

#test function with angle is a negative number, direction goes backward ->passed
drawSpiral(70, -40, 1)

#test function with angle=60deg, increased by 5 ->passed
turtle.color("blue")
drawSpiral(90, 60, 5)   
  
#test function with angle=600deg, increased by 20 -->Passed
turtle.color("black")
drawSpiral(190, 600, 20)
