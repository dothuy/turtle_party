#Turtle party
#Create a polygon function that takes the number of sides and length of each side as parameters & draws the appropriate shape by turning 360 (the number of degrees in a circle) divided by the number of sides. Challenge: print an error message & draw nothing if there are less than 3 sides.

    for i in range(side):

      turtle.left(360/side)
    print("ok, here is a polygon with",i, 'sides')
    
  else:
    print("Error! Can't draw a Polygon with less than 3 sides")
    

#drawPolygon, side range from 1 to 20
for i in range(1,20): 
  if i%2 == 0:
    turtle.color("green")
